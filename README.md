# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning

Clustering is an unsupervisedlearning method that allows us to group set of objects based on similar characteristics. In general, it can help you find meaningful structure among your data, group similar data together and discover underlying patterns.
One of the most common clustering methods is K-means algorithm. The goal of this algorithm isto partition the data into set such that the total sum of squared distances from each point to the mean point of the cluster is minimized.
